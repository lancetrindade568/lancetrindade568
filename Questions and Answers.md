1] Would TypeScript be worth using for an app of this size?

- There are quite a few great benefits of using TypeScript, especially:
Instant type error detection
Better IDE experience
More self-documenting code
More readable & easier to understand
However, this comes at a cost. TypeScript, requires much more time to compile. To me, the time taken to create the project and the project size are somewhat insignificant. However, when it comes to the re-compile time, time taken for the change in our code to show up, it get’s really tricky. I’ve always wondered why angular projects take so long compared to react and vue to re-compile, and I think I know why now. TypeScript seems to add quite a big overhead even when re-compiling an out of the box.

2] Would a UI toolkit such as Bootstrap or Material UI be useful?

I think that it is amazing to develop websites quicker and easier to use at a daily basis. Bootstrap or Material UI is easy to understand and it has much pre-design class. We can add pre-defined class into the code without writing code. Its a framework that helps to create responsive web applications but it is ideally not beneficial to use on a single react application.

3] Would state management middleware be useful?
- React applications are built using components and they manage their state internally and it works well for applications with few components, but when the application grows bigger, the complexity of managing states shared across components becomes difficult. If developers do not have scalability in mind then it is really hard to find out what is happening when something goes wrong. This is why you need state management in your application.

4] How would it be possible to enforce specific source code standards?
- Coding Standards Cultivate a Culture of Excellence. Full Compliance Minimizes Errors, Rework, and Delays. Full compliance avoids costly common errors early in the development process. This in turn avoids rework and last-minute delays. A positive feedback loop of reduced defects in the field. Teams want to work on innovative new features for dynamic and expanding products. Committing to a recognized coding standard is a competitive advantage. It allows you to open doors to new customers. Improvements in delivery, quality, and security can only be achieved with an examination of every line of code.

5] Would automated tests be useful and if so what could/should be tested?
- Automated software testing can increase the depth and scope of tests to help improve software quality. Lengthy tests that are often avoided during manual testing can be run unattended. They can even be run on multiple computers with different configurations. Automated software testing can look inside an application and see memory contents, data tables, file contents, and internal program states to determine if the product is behaving as expected.
